I have worked through the happy git website and have read both the of the articles you suggested. From this work I have prepared a general outline for the github/version control week. Please note that this is just a general idea of what I am thinking. I have not yet prepared any material towards this goal or developed an excerise that would serve as homework, though I would want it to deal with forking and cloning a repo to Github then to a local computer, setting the upstream repo on a local computer to pull from, making a change on a local computer, pushing your change back to Github, and then submitting a pull request back to the upstream repo.
