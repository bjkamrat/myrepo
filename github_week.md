BAE 565 Github Week Outline
================
01-15-2021

I have worked through the happy git website and have read both the of
the articles you suggested. From this work I have prepared a general
outline for the github/version control week. Please note that this is
just a general idea of what I am thinking. I have not yet prepared any
material towards this goal.

# Work to be done prior to 1/26/21

  - Read sections 1-4 of Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About
    Version Control?
  - Complete Section “1. Installation” on <https://happygitwithr.com/>

## \# 1/26/21: In class work
